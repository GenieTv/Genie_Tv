First, Piers meets Amanda Lewis, who is serving a life sentence for killing her daughter. In rural Florida, seven-year-old Adrianna Hutto drowned in the family&apos;s outdoor pool. It looked like an accident, but Adrianna&apos;s younger brother AJ told police that his mum had deliberately dunked Adrianna as a punishment for being naughty. Piers finds out what it was like for Amanda to sit across from her son as he testified against her, and ultimately asks her the burning question - did she do it? Next, Piers travels to Texas for an encounter with Rhonda Glover, a former beauty queen and rodeo star who gunned down her lover in cold blood. Rhonda and her boyfriend Jimmy Joste shared a glamorous lifestyle built on the riches of his oil business, but their relationship spiralled into drug-fuelled obsession and paranoia before ending in murder</desc></programme><programme start="20180522004500 +0100" stop="20180522030000 +0100" channel="ITV1TyneTees.uk" ><title>Jackpot247</title><desc>Description not available</desc></programme><programme start="20180522030000 +0100" stop="20180522035000 +0100" channel="ITV1TyneTees.uk" ><title>The Jeremy Kyle Show</title><desc>Jeremy Kyle deals with more dilemmas, fiery confrontations and topical issues all in front of a studio audience</desc></programme><programme start="20180522035000 +0100" stop="20180522050500 +0100" channel="ITV1TyneTees.uk" ><title>ITV Nightscreen</title><desc>Description not available</desc></programme><programme start="20180522050500 +0100" stop="20180522060000 +0100" channel="ITV1TyneTees.uk" ><title>The Jeremy Kyle Show</title><desc>Jeremy Kyle deals with more dilemmas, fiery confrontations and topical issues in front of a studio audience</desc></programme><programme start="20180522060000 +0100" stop="20180522083000 +0100" channel="ITV1TyneTees.uk" ><title>Good Morning Britain</title><desc>Description not available</desc></programme><programme start="20180522083000 +0100" stop="20180522092500 +0100" channel="ITV1TyneTees.uk" ><title>Lorraine</title><desc>Description not available</desc></programme><programme start="20180522092500 +0100" stop="20180522103000 +0100" channel="ITV1TyneTees.uk" ><title>The Jeremy Kyle Show</title><desc>Jeremy Kyle deals with more dilemmas, fiery confrontations and topical issues all in front of a studio audience</desc></programme><programme start="20180522103000 +0100" stop="20180522123000 +0100" channel="ITV1TyneTees.uk" ><title>This Morning</title><desc>Description not available</desc></programme><programme start="20180522123000 +0100" stop="20180522133000 +0100" channel="ITV1TyneTees.uk" ><title>Loose Women</title><desc>Description not available</desc></programme><programme start="20180522133000 +0100" stop="20180522135500 +0100" channel="ITV1TyneTees.uk" ><title>ITV Lunchtime News</title><desc>Description not available</desc></programme><programme start="20180522135500 +0100" stop="20180522140000 +0100" channel="ITV1TyneTees.uk" ><title>ITV News Tyne Tees</title><desc>Description not available</desc></programme><programme start="20180522140000 +0100" stop="20180522150000 +0100" channel="ITV1TyneTees.uk" ><title>Judge Rinder&apos;s Crime Stories</title><desc>Judge Robert Rinder looks at the case of a woman who suffered a horrific acid attack and a mother whose life was torn apart as her infant son lay in a coma</desc></programme><programme start="20180522150000 +0100" stop="20180522160000 +0100" channel="ITV1TyneTees.uk" ><title>Dickinson&apos;s Real Deal</title><desc>David Dickinson and his dealers are in Llandudno in North Wales where Michael Hogben gets a blast from the past.

general knowledge questions on this quiz show. Their opponent? The Chaser, a ruthless quiz genius tasked with stopping the contestants from winning money, potentially thousands of pounds. The contestants take turns answering quick-fire questions in a set length of time in order to build up the team&apos;s pot. Each contestant then goes one-on-one against The Chaser. The Chaser follows the contestant down a game board. If the contestant gets out without being caught, the money he or she earned is added to the team&apos;s pot. If a contestant is caught (by answering questions incorrectly), the contestant is out of the game and no money is added to the team&apos;s pot. The final round features the remaining contestants in another quick-fire round in which each correct answer gets them closer to the finish line. If The Chaser catches all the contestants, they leave with nothing. If any contestants remain at the end of the game, they split the team&apos;s money.</desc></programme><programme start="20180522210000 +0100" stop="20180522220000 +0100" channel="Challenge.uk" ><title>The Chase</title><desc>Four strangers work as a team to answer general knowledge questions.

Stewart, is now presented by the experienced game show and trivia host Sandi Toksvig. Every episode, 15 contestants stand behind lecterns in a semi circle facing the quizmaster, where they are asked a series of very difficult questions with just three seconds to respond. Each contestant has three lives before they are eliminated. In total, twelve contestants are eliminated during the first two rounds, leaving the final three to compete in the final round. The winners of this round are then invited back at a later date to compete in the &quot;Grand Final&quot; against the other winners, with the chance of winning a 40,000 cash prize.</desc></programme><programme start="20180522060000 +0100" stop="20180522064500 +0100" channel="Channel4.uk" ><title>Countdown</title><desc>Nick Hewer and Rachel Riley host as contestants race against the clock to pit their wits against vowels, consonants and numbers.
